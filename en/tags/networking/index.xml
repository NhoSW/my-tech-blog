Hints were correctly applied to EndpointSlices, but had no actual effect. AWS Load Balancer Controller&amp;rsquo;s IP target mode bypasses kube-proxy entirely, and our primary internal workloads — Spark, Trino, Airflow — are all single-zone or stateful, meaning the traffic paths where hints get referenced simply don&amp;rsquo;t exist in our environment.</description></item><item><title>Kafka Rack Awareness and Spark: Not Supported Yet</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/kafka-rack-awareness-spark/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/kafka-rack-awareness-spark/</guid><description>We tried to apply Kafka rack awareness to Spark jobs to reduce cross-AZ network costs. Getting the AZ information was solved easily via AWS IMDS, but Spark itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t support rack-aware Kafka partition assignment. The related Jira ticket is open but the PR was closed.</description></item></channel></rss>
