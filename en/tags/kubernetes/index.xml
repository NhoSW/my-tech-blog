Redeploying the coordinator means downtime. We adopted Trino Gateway to enable Blue/Green deployments with zero downtime and route BI/OLAP queries to separate clusters based on HTTP headers.</description></item><item><title>EMR on EKS VPA Review: When an Official AWS Feature Doesn't Work</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/emr-on-eks-vpa-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/emr-on-eks-vpa-review/</guid><description>We tried using AWS&amp;rsquo;s built-in VPA integration for EMR on EKS to auto-optimize Spark executor resources. After about a month of intensive PoC work, multiple AWS support cases, and a custom manifest bundle rebuild, the operator still didn&amp;rsquo;t work. We abandoned it.</description></item><item><title>Kafka Rack Awareness and Spark: Not Supported Yet</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/kafka-rack-awareness-spark/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/kafka-rack-awareness-spark/</guid><description>We tried to apply Kafka rack awareness to Spark jobs to reduce cross-AZ network costs. Getting the AZ information was solved easily via AWS IMDS, but Spark itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t support rack-aware Kafka partition assignment. The related Jira ticket is open but the PR was closed.</description></item><item><title>Trino Alluxio Cache PoC: EBS Throughput Was the Bottleneck</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/trino-alluxio-cache-poc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/trino-alluxio-cache-poc/</guid><description>We ran a PoC of Trino&amp;rsquo;s Alluxio-based file system cache in a production OLAP environment. Adding the cache alone didn&amp;rsquo;t help much. The default EBS throughput of 125 MiB/s was the bottleneck. After bumping it to 1000 MiB/s, query performance improved visibly and S3 API costs dropped by ~$3,200/month.</description></item><item><title>Trino v451 to v476: Upgrading a Production Cluster Across 25 Versions</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/trino-v476-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/trino-v476-upgrade/</guid><description>We upgraded Trino from v451 to v476 — 25 minor versions in one jump. Blue/Green deployment on our OLAP clusters caught two regressions: a Materialized View refresh bug and a Parquet read failure. We binary-searched the root cause down to a single v469 commit and got a community fix within a day.</description></item><item><title>Building an ALB Log Pipeline with Filebeat, Flink, and Iceberg</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/alb-log-collection-system/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/alb-log-collection-system/</guid><description>We needed to turn CSV ALB logs sitting in S3 into a queryable Iceberg table. The first attempt with Flink&amp;rsquo;s filesystem connector ran out of memory. This post covers the redesign with Filebeat + SQS + Kafka, autoscaling, checkpoint tuning, and the operational surprises we hit along the way.</description></item><item><title>Building a Proxy Server with Apache APISIX: De-identifying 1.3 Billion Daily Logs</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/apisix-proxy-server-guide/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/apisix-proxy-server-guide/</guid><description>We needed to strip PII from app logs before sending them to an overseas tracking server. This post covers our journey from Fluent-bit to Kong to APISIX, custom Lua plugin development, 55K TPS load testing, and Kubernetes deployment.</description></item><item><title>NVIDIA MIG Setup Guide: Splitting One A100 GPU Into Many</title><link>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/nvidia-mig-setup-guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nanta-data.dev/en/posts/nvidia-mig-setup-guide/</guid><description>Four A100 GPUs can yield up to 28 independent GPU instances. This guide covers MIG concepts, mig-parted installation, diverse slice configurations, and Kubernetes integration based on hands-on experience.</description></item></channel></rss>
